# Area-Reader
The area reader file is a code that is written in the Java language that has the capability to read out the area of certain shapes that are instilled in the code. There are six different files contained in this project; Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java, Point.java, Shape.java, and Main.java. The files that are named after shapes are files that contain classes that each contain the algorithm to compute the area of each shape that it is named after. Each of the classes contains variables of each of the constants that are needed to calculate the area for each shape. All of the variables are defined as doubles so the values that are taken into consideration can be values that contain decimal values.

Triangle contains: (1/2(B)(H))

Base

Height

Rectangle contains: (L(W))

Length

Width

Circle contains:(Pi(r^2))

Radius
